- Ensure all functions and variables are commented
- Ensure everything is up to par with JavaDoc standards and style
- Provide a link in each comment to the corresponding C++ function/varible
  in the C++ documentation.
- Current Direct() and Inverse() implementations compute all output variables.
  Would be nice to provide a way (other than GenDirect()/GenInverse()) for clients
  to choose which variables to compute.
- Create a base class that DirectResult and InverseResult classes can both inherit
  from which contains the shared variables and functions of both classes.
- Implement the Line() function (requires implementing GeoLine first)

- Ensure C++ exceptions get translated into Java Exceptionx
